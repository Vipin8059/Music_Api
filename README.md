## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the project:

* springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui (swagger)
* Spring Web
* Spring Data JPA
* MySQL Driver
* Lombok
* Validation

* Implemented CRUD operations with data validation, MySQL database configuration, 
 authentication and established table relationships.
This project is a portal that handles different types of relationships ( many-to-one, and many-to-many) between various entities. It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each model, allowing you to manage the data effectively.

>## Data flow
In this project, we have four layers-
* **Controller** - The controller layer handles the  requests, translates the JSON parameter to object, and authenticates the request and transfer it to the business (service) layer. In short, it consists of views i.e., frontend part.
* **Service** -The business layer handles all the business logic. It consists of service classes and uses services provided by data access layers.
* **Repository** - This layer mainatains the CRUD operations are performed
* **Model** - This layer consists basically the class level things- the various classes required for the project and these classes consists the attributes to be stored.
* **dto** -this layer SignupInput,SignUpOutput which store the data of user to Authentication.

## Models
